# Contributing to RemarkableSync

Thank you for your interest in contributing to RemarkableSync! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RemarkableSync.git
   cd RemarkableSync
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. **Run the tool in development mode:**
   ```bash
   python RemarkableSync.py --help
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

This project uses:
- **Black** for code formatting (line length: 100)
- **Ruff** for linting
- **isort** for import sorting

Format your code before committing:
```bash
black .
ruff check --fix .
isort .
```

### Type Hints

Use type hints for all function parameters and return values where possible. The project targets Python 3.11+.

### Testing

Run tests before submitting pull requests:
```bash
pytest
```

For coverage reports:
```bash
pytest --cov=src
```

## Making Changes

### Branch Strategy

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of changes"
   ```

3. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add details in the body if needed

Examples:
- `Add support for v7 notebook format`
- `Fix template rendering issue on Windows`
- `Update dependencies to latest versions`

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your code passes all checks:**
   - Code is formatted with Black
   - No linting errors from Ruff
   - All tests pass
   - Type hints are present where appropriate

2. **Update documentation:**
   - Update README.md if adding features
   - Add docstrings to new functions/classes
   - Update RECENT_CHANGES.md if applicable

3. **Describe your changes:**
   - Explain what the PR does and why
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

4. **Wait for review:**
   - Address any feedback from maintainers
   - Be patient and responsive to comments
